### Javascript
Javascript is an Object Oriented and dynamically typed language which is cross platform.
It is widely in context of making of web pages. It has both client side as well as server side extension.


### ECMA and Javascript
JavaScript builds upon ECMAScript as ECMAScript is the standardized specification that defines JavaScriptâ€™s core features, while JavaScript is an implementation that extends ECMAScript with additional, often browser-specific, features.

JavaScript is essentially ECMAScript with extra features (like DOM and browser APIs), making it a practical superset of ECMAScript.
